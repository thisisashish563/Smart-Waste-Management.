# Smart-Waste-Management.
Urban waste management inefficiencies require innovative solutions integrating deep learning and IoT.
1. Overflowing bins lead to unsanitary conditions, environmental hazards, and increased operational expenses.
2. Traditional approaches lack real-time monitoring and optimization capabilities, resulting in suboptimal waste collection routes.
3. There's a critical need for innovative solutions leveraging modern technology to address these challenges and promote sustainability.
4. Our project aims to develop a Smart Dustbin System (SDS) using deep learning and IoT technologies to monitor waste levels and optimize collection routes.
5. The current ways of collecting trash aren't good enough for crowded cities.
6.Our project will use smart technology to track trash levels and figure out the best way to collect it.
